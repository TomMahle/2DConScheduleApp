# 2DConScheduleApp
2D Con should really have a schedule app. Let's make one.

Things you'll need/want:
VS Code / some nice text editor
ConEmu / some command prompt you're happy with
Git + some client
node and then run:
npm install ionic -g
npm install gulp -g
npm install cordova -g

after that navigate to the directory you've cloned this repository into and run:
npm install
when that finishes run
ionic serve
in one command prompt in order to run the app and
gulp tdd
in another command prompt in order to see test results.

There's probably some other stuff I've forgotten about, so feel free to reach out if you're having issues :).
