# 2DConScheduleApp
2D Con should really have a schedule app. Let's make one.

## Things you'll need/want:
* VS Code / some nice text editor
* ConEmu / some command prompt you're happy with
* Git + some client
* node 

Once Node is installed, open a command prompt and run the following commands:
* npm install ionic -g
* npm install gulp -g
* npm install cordova -g

## Starting the app
Once done installing all of the tooling, navigate to the directory you've cloned this repository into and run the following commands in command prompt/terminal/your shell of choice:
* npm install

when that finishes run

* ionic serve

in one command prompt in order to run the app and

* gulp tdd

in another command prompt in order to see test results.

There's probably some other stuff I've forgotten about, so feel free to reach out if you're having issues :).
